## üöß In Progress

### Phase 8: Data Integration (Current Priority)

#### üéØ **Immediate Next Steps** (High Priority)
- [ ] **IPFS Integration** (Critical for saving designs):
  - [x] Pinata integration exists in GenerateKitService
  - [ ] Connect IPFS storage to AI texture workflow
  - [ ] Implement design save/load from IPFS
  - [ ] Metadata storage for generated designs
  - [ ] Design versioning and history

- [ ] **Real Data Integration**:
  - [ ] Replace mock data in Gallery with API calls
  - [ ] Replace mock data in Dashboard with real user data
  - [ ] Connect design creation to persistent storage
  - [ ] Implement design sharing and export functionality

- [ ] **Blockchain Deployment**:
  - [ ] Deploy DesignCandidate contract to Chiliz Spicy testnet
  - [ ] Deploy Governor contract to Chiliz Spicy testnet
  - [ ] Contract verification and configuration
  - [ ] Connect frontend to deployed contracts

#### üîÑ **Development Priorities** (Medium Priority)

## üéØ **Current Status & Next Action**

### üöÄ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Complete AI-to-3D Workflow! 

The core user experience is **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**:
‚úÖ **Prompt ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Apply** workflow complete
‚úÖ Users can generate AI textures and see them on 3D models instantly
‚úÖ Complete texture management with browser storage
‚úÖ Professional light mode interface with glass design system
‚úÖ Comprehensive 3D lighting and camera optimization
‚úÖ **Production-ready builder** with all debugging tools removed (Jan 2025)

### üìä **Implementation Status**:
- **Phase 1-7**: 100% Complete ‚úÖ
- **Phase 8**: 30% Complete üöß
- **Phase 9-11**: 0% Complete ‚ùå

### üéØ **Recommended Next Action**

Based on current progress, I recommend prioritizing **IPFS Integration** since:

1. ‚úÖ **Core functionality works** - Users can generate and preview designs
2. ‚úÖ **UI is complete** - All interfaces are built and functional
3. üéØ **Missing persistence** - Designs are lost on page refresh
4. üîó **Enables sharing** - IPFS storage allows design sharing and portfolio

**Suggested Implementation Order:**
1. **Connect IPFS to AI texture workflow** (2-3 days)
2. **Implement design save/load functionality** (2-3 days)
3. **Replace mock data with real API calls** (2-3 days)
4. **Deploy smart contracts to testnet** (1-2 days)
5. **Connect voting interface to deployed contracts** (2-3 days)

This would complete the **"Generate ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Vote"** workflow! üé®

## üîß Technical Notes

### Current Architecture Strengths:
- ‚úÖ **Clean separation of concerns** with atomic components

### Technical Debt:
- [ ] Connect existing IPFS service to texture workflow
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries for API failures
- [ ] Implement proper authentication state management
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for new AI and 3D components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (currently includes unused 3D assets)
