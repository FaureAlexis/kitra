## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Phase 5: Core Functionality (Current Priority)

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Next Steps** (High Priority)
- [ ] **AI Integration** (Ready for implementation):
  - [ ] Configure Mastra workflow with OpenAI
  - [ ] Connect AI prompt form to DALL-E 3 API
  - [ ] Implement texture generation from natural language
  - [ ] Add loading states and error handling for AI generation

- [ ] **3D Model Enhancement**:
  - [ ] Source or create proper football kit GLB models
  - [ ] Implement dynamic texture mapping on 3D models
  - [ ] Add material property controls (fabric, shine, etc.)
  - [ ] Export functionality for generated designs

- [ ] **IPFS Storage** (Critical for saving designs):
  - [ ] Implement Pinata integration for design assets
  - [ ] Upload/download workflow for textures and models
  - [ ] Metadata storage for designs
  - [ ] Design versioning and history

#### ðŸ”„ **Development Priorities** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Design Workflow**:
  - [ ] Save/load user designs from IPFS
  - [ ] Design gallery with user's creations
  - [ ] Share design functionality
  - [ ] Design export (PNG, GLB, metadata)

### Phase 6: Blockchain Integration
- [ ] **Smart Contract Deployment**:
  - [ ] Deploy to Chiliz Spicy testnet
  - [ ] Contract verification and configuration
  - [ ] Role-based access control setup
  - [ ] Initial governance parameters

- [ ] **Web3 Functionality**:
  - [ ] NFT minting workflow for approved designs
  - [ ] Governance voting interface
  - [ ] Transaction handling and UX
  - [ ] Error handling for Web3 operations

## ðŸ“… Upcoming

### Phase 7: Business Logic
- [ ] **Governance System**:
  - [ ] Submit design for community voting
  - [ ] Voting period management
  - [ ] Results calculation and winner selection
  - [ ] Reward distribution system

- [ ] **User Management**:
  - [ ] Enhanced user profiles with Web3 identity
  - [ ] Design portfolio and analytics
  - [ ] Earnings tracking and history
  - [ ] Community reputation system

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Real-time Features**:
  - [ ] Live design collaboration
  - [ ] Real-time voting updates
  - [ ] Design status notifications
  - [ ] Community chat/comments

- [ ] **Analytics & Insights**:
  - [ ] User behavior tracking
  - [ ] Design performance metrics
  - [ ] Platform usage statistics
  - [ ] Revenue and governance analytics

### Phase 9: Production Ready
- [ ] **Security & Performance**:
  - [ ] Smart contract security audit
  - [ ] Frontend security review
  - [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Error tracking and monitoring

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Next Action**

Based on current progress, I recommend starting with **AI Integration** since:

1. âœ… **UI is ready** - Glass design system and prompt interface complete
2. âœ… **Architecture is clean** - Easy to add AI service layer
3. ðŸŽ¯ **High impact** - Users can immediately see AI-generated designs
4. ðŸ”— **Enables other features** - Generated textures can be saved to IPFS

**Suggested Implementation Order:**
1. **Set up Mastra + OpenAI integration** (1-2 days)
2. **Connect AI prompt to DALL-E 3** (1-2 days)  
3. **Add texture mapping to 3D model** (1-2 days)
4. **Implement IPFS storage for designs** (2-3 days)
5. **Add design save/load functionality** (1-2 days)

This would create a complete **"Prompt â†’ Generate â†’ Preview â†’ Save"** workflow! ðŸš€
